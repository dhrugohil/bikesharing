This analysis was carried out to create important analysis and visualizations for a start-up in New York City called Citibike. The information will be used by the dierectors of Citibike to make decisions on the operations of the company to ensure high quality customet service and high levels of profitability. 
The visualizations show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary

Based of the results. It is important to note that there is a high demand of bikes later during the day after 5pm, probably because, it is when most people gets off work, with males spending more time with the bikes than females.
It is also vital to note that bike repairs and maintenance should be carried out at 12-4am, when demand for the bikes are very low.

I would suggest he directors of Citibike to look into two additional visualozations:

- The relationship between the ages of the users and the start/stop time and locations as well as the duration of their ride. This will give a key insight into the customer base for the company for important decision making.
- The relationship between the tripduration and bikeID. This will give the company information on which bikes need maintenance to keep smooth running of bikes.
